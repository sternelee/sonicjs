/**
 * Two-factor policy: the knobs `twoFactor()` is composed from in `auth/config.ts`.
 *
 * ── Why the getter is synchronous ──
 * `createAuth()` is synchronous and runs on EVERY request (app.ts session middleware), and
 * BA reads `issuer` / `accountLockout` / `backupCodeOptions` off the static options object it
 * was constructed with — `verify-two-factor.mjs` pulls the lockout config via
 * `ctx.context.getPlugin('two-factor')?.options`, not through a resolver. So the values have
 * to be available *at construction time*, and construction cannot await a D1 read without
 * putting a round-trip on the authenticated hot path.
 *
 * The split is therefore: {@link loadTwoFactorPolicy} (async, one D1 read) is called once per
 * isolate from the plugin's `onBoot`, and {@link getTwoFactorPolicy} (sync) is what
 * `getDefaultAuthOptions` reads. Ordering is guaranteed by app.ts: the `boot()` middleware
 * that runs plugin `onBoot` is registered ahead of the session middleware, and it is awaited.
 *
 * ── Staleness contract ──
 * One load per isolate, no TTL — the same contract `isPluginActive()` already ships with.
 * A settings change takes effect on new isolates immediately and on a warm one when it
 * recycles, or right away in the isolate that performed the write if it calls
 * {@link invalidateTwoFactorPolicy}. Before the first load, and on any read failure, the
 * DEFAULTS below apply.
 *
 * Be precise about what that buys, because an earlier version of this comment overstated it:
 * the defaults are the SHIPPED defaults, not the extreme end of each range (5 attempts and 900s
 * sit mid-way through BOUNDS' 3–10 and 300–3600). So a failed load reverts an operator's
 * override in EITHER direction — someone who tightened `maxFailedAttempts` to 3 gets 5 back.
 * What is actually guaranteed is the BOUND, not the direction: every value the policy can ever
 * take, loaded or defaulted, is inside BOUNDS, so no read failure and no stored value can
 * disable the lockout or reduce backup codes below 5.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: nothing gates whether `twoFactor()` is composed at all. That is
 * deliberate — see the ADR in project-plan.md. Plugin status gates the enrolment surface;
 * it must never gate verification, or deactivating the plugin would silently downgrade every
 * enrolled account to password-only while the UI still read "Enabled".
