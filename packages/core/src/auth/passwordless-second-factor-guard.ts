/**
 * Refuse passwordless (email-possession) sign-in for accounts that hold a verified second
 * factor.
 *
 * ── The hole this closes ──
 * Better Auth's `twoFactor` plugin challenges on `/sign-in/email|username|phone-number` and
 * nothing else. `auth/config.ts` also composes `magicLink` and `emailOTP`, both of which mint a
 * full session on their own endpoints. So without this guard, a user who enrolled in TOTP could
 * sign in with a link or code mailed to their inbox and never see a second factor — with
 * `/admin/profile` still reading "Enabled". A control that reports success and does nothing is
 * worse than no control.
 *
 * It is also incoherent on its own terms: email possession is exactly what the design refuses to
 * accept AS a second factor, so it cannot be allowed to stand in for the first one plus the
 * second.
 *
 * ── Why here and not in a BA hook ──
 * `magic-link/verify` finishes with `throw ctx.redirect(callbackURL)`, so a BA `after` hook is
 * not a dependable chokepoint. The `/auth/*` catch-all in `app.ts` is our own code, runs ahead
 * of `auth.handler()`, and can read the request body — so the block lands on the request that
 * would START the flow, before any token or code is mailed.
 *
 * ── Enumeration ──
 * Every refusal is byte-identical to what Better Auth itself would answer, so an unauthenticated
 * caller learns nothing about who has a second factor:
 *   - the INITIATE endpoints return BA's own success shape and send nothing. BA already answers
 *     `{success:true}` for an address with no account at all, so this adds no new signal.
 *   - the COMPLETE endpoint returns BA's own `INVALID_OTP` error. An earlier revision returned a
 *     distinctive `403 TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED` here, justified by "the caller already produced a
 *     code from the inbox" — which was FALSE: this guard runs before BA validates the code, so
 *     `{"email":"…","otp":"000000"}` with no inbox access was a free oracle for both
 *     account-existence and 2FA-enrolment status. Do not reintroduce a distinguishable response.
 *
 * ── Deliberately NOT guarded ──
 *   - `/auth/callback/*` (social/OAuth). BA does not challenge there either. Delegating MFA to
 *     the identity provider is the conventional contract, and blocking it would lock out an
 *     account whose only credential is the provider.
 *   - `GET /auth/magic-link/verify`. **A residual window remains here, and it is not closed.**
 *     Blocking the send means an enrolled user never receives a NEW link, but a link mailed in
 *     the 15 minutes BEFORE they enrolled still resolves to a session with no second factor. It
 *     is not guarded because the token cannot be resolved to a user without consuming it: BA
 *     stores verification values in KV (this app supplies `secondaryStorage`, and
 *     `verification.storeInDatabase` is unset, so `auth_verification` is not used), keyed by
 *     BA's internal format, and `storeToken` is not exported. Closing it properly means moving
 *     verification values into D1 — a repo-wide change affecting magic-link, email-OTP and email
 *     verification, out of scope here. The exposure requires an attacker who owns the inbox AND a
 *     link requested in the same 15-minute window in which the victim enrolled.
 *   - `/auth/email-otp/verify-email`. It mints a session only under
 *     `emailVerification.autoSignInAfterVerification`, which SonicJS does not set; guarding it
 *     unconditionally would 403 legitimate email verification for enrolled users. **If that
 *     option is ever enabled, add the path to {@link COMPLETE_PATHS}.**
 *   - `/auth/email-otp/request-password-reset`, `/forget-password/email-otp`,
 *     `/email-otp/reset-password`. Password reset does not mint a session in this codebase — it
 *     redirects to the login page, where the second factor is enforced.
 *
 * Bespoke SonicJS session-minting endpoints under `/auth/` (the `otp-login` and
 * `oauth-providers` plugins) are mounted BEFORE this catch-all and so never reach it; they call
 * {@link hasVerifiedSecondFactor} directly in their own handlers.
