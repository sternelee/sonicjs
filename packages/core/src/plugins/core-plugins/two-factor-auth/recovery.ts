/**
 * Administrative recovery for two-factor auth — the break-glass path.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──
 * Without it, the complete list of ways back into an account with a lost authenticator is:
 * an unused backup code, or `wrangler d1 execute --remote`. Everything an operator would
 * reasonably reach for is closed by design:
 *
 *   - Password reset does not mint a session (`passwordless-second-factor-guard.ts`), so it
 *     hands the user a new password and the same unpassable challenge.
 *   - Magic link and email OTP are refused outright for enrolled users — whoever owns the
 *     inbox would otherwise own the account, which is the thing the second factor is for.
 *   - Self-service disable requires a session, which requires the second factor.
 *
 * So a sole admin who enrols and then loses phone and codes locks the entire organisation out
 * of the admin portal, recoverable only by someone holding Cloudflare credentials. This turns
 * that incident into another admin clicking a button.
 *
 * ── The cost, stated plainly ──
 * This makes any admin account a path around any user's second factor. It does NOT hand over
 * the account — the password is still required, and this never touches it — but it does remove
 * a control from someone else's account. Hence: admin role required, the target's email must be
 * typed back, and every use writes a `two_factor_reset` security event.
 *
 * ── Not behind the deactivate→404 gate ──
 * `twoFactorAdminRoutes` 404s when the plugin is deactivated. These routes deliberately do not,
 * for the same reason the login challenge does not: `auth/config.ts` composes Better Auth's
 * `twoFactor` plugin unconditionally, so deactivating this plugin stops nothing about
 * verification — enrolled users are still challenged. A recovery path that disappeared exactly
 * when the surface was turned off would be worse than none, because the lockout it is meant to
 * fix would still be happening.
 *
 * Mounted on its own prefix (`/admin/two-factor-reset`) rather than under `/admin/two-factor`:
 * Hono flattens `app.route()` sub-apps into the parent, so anything mounted at the enrolment
 * prefix would inherit that sub-app's `use('*')` deactivate gate — the very thing this must not
 * have.

 *     exist. Deactivating the plugin is the operator's own escape hatch from a bad required-flag.
 *
 * Mounted from app.ts on BOTH `/admin/*` and `/api/*`, rather than from the plugin's `register()`,
 * because Hono composes matched handlers in registration order: plugin registration runs
 * interleaved with the `app.route(...)` calls, so middleware added there would silently not run for

 * challenging (its after-hook reads `user.twoFactorEnabled`) and the passwordless sign-in paths
 * re-open (`hasVerifiedSecondFactor` keys off the row this deletes). Meanwhile the admin who set
 * the requirement has no signal, because a BA disable writes none of our audit events.
 *
 * ── Why here ──
 * Same chokepoint and same reasoning as {@link guardPasswordlessSecondFactor}: the `/auth/*`
 * catch-all in `app.ts` is our own code and runs ahead of `auth.handler()`, so the refusal lands
 * before BA deletes anything. A BA `after` hook would fire after the write.
 *
 * ── Not an enumeration risk ──
 * Unlike the passwordless guard, this answers a caller already authenticated AS the account in
 * question, so a plain-language reason leaks nothing about anyone else — and the user needs to
 * know why the button did not work.
 *
 * Fails OPEN, matching {@link enforceTwoFactorEnrolment}: `readPolicyState` resolves to "not
